## Magic Words for Issues and Pull Requests

Using magic words in your commits, issues, and pull requests makes it easier to automatically manage issues in the repository. 
These keywords allow you to close or reference issues directly when integrating changes. 
Below are details on what they are and how to use them:

### Closing Magic Words

When you use any of these keywords followed by the issue number, GitHub will automatically close the issue when you merge the commit or pull request.

**Magic words that close issues automatically:**

- `close`
- `closes`
- `closed`
- `closing`
- `fix`
- `fixes`
- `fixed`
- `fixing`
- `resolve`
- `resolves`
- `resolved`
- `resolving`
- `complete`
- `completes`
- `completed`
- `completing`

### Non-Closing Magic Words

These words are used to reference related issues without automatically closing them. 
They are useful when the change is part of a larger solution or is not yet complete.

**Magic words that reference without closing:**

- `ref`
- `references`
- `part of`
- `related to`
- `contributes to`
- `towards`
